1. Privacy
Your privacy is important. This app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, photos, or videos to external servers. All processing of images and videos is performed locally on your device. The app does not share your information with third parties.

2. Functionality Disclaimer
This app applies visual filters to faces in photos and videos to reduce the accuracy of AI-based recognition. While designed to provide privacy protection, results are not guaranteed. The app may occasionally misalign filters, incorrectly mask faces, or provide approximate similarity scores compared to the original photo.

3. Limitation of Liability
By using this app, you acknowledge that the developer is not responsible for any loss, damage, or misidentification arising from use of the app. The effectiveness of face masking or anonymization may vary depending on lighting, image quality, facial features, AI recognition methods, and other factors. No guarantees are provided regarding complete privacy or unrecognizability.

4. No Claims on Effectiveness
The app is provided “as-is” for personal privacy enhancement purposes only. Users agree that reducing similarity to 70% or more is considered a satisfactory result; 100% masking is not guaranteed or required. Users accept all responsibility for how they use the app and the results obtained.

5. Video Limit
The maximum video length for processing is 3 minutes. Longer videos are not supported and may produce unpredictable results.

6. Updates & Changes
The app may be updated to improve features or privacy methods. Users are responsible for checking updates and using the app according to the latest version. The developer reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy and Disclaimer at any time.

By using this app, you agree to all terms outlined above and acknowledge that no legal claims may be made regarding the accuracy, effectiveness, or results of the app.
